No one comes here for a sled run. If you&rsquo;re not going to be able to get up and go cross country until lake cowichan then the bomb out landing field is available but not recommended.</p><p>Generally considered an afternoon site.</p><p>Access. No gate. High clearance. 4x4 recommended.</p><p>Difficulty. P3 recommended.</p><p>T/O is a short clearing on the side of a logging in road. If you get your take off wrong you get to plow into an overgrown block of stumps and logging refuse.</p><p>The closest landing is about 2:1 correctly below. However it&rsquo;s a logging road surrounded by tall trees.</p></div>
