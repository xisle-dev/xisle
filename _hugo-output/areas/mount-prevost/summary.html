In the right conditions is can be useful for low our pilots to get familiar with thermal flying.</p><p>There are three take off areas, East, West and Southish (aka &ldquo;Main&rdquo;). While the landing field is surrounded by high tension wires the field is enormous and landing in the middle of the field should not be a problem in any wind direction.</p><p>The main risk flying at Prevost is that the most common prevailing wind is NNE. This wraps around from Mount Sicker and presents as an East wind. This frequently fool pilots into using the East launch and then facing a very sinky headwind push toward the lower east ridge. The trees consume many gliders this way. While it may be possible to fly there in a north wind with strong southerly thermal flow. This thought process will eventually catch you. You&rsquo;ve been warned.</p><p>In haying season the farmer get a bit cranky if we are trampling the hay or blocking the driveway. Please respect the Framer&rsquo;s and the owner requests.</p></div><div></div>
