South facing ridge a few kilometers east of lake Cowichan. No one comes here for a sled run. If you're not going to be able to get up and go cross country until lake cowichan then the bomb out landing field is available but not recommended.

Generally considered an afternoon site.

Access. No gate. High clearance. 4x4 recommended.

Difficulty. P3 recommended.

T/O is a short clearing on the side of a logging in road. If you get your take off wrong you get to plow into an overgrown block of stumps and logging refuse.

The closest landing is about 2:1 correctly below. However it's a logging road surrounded by tall trees.
